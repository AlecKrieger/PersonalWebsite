                    This project began in the summer of 2023 after my rommmates 
                    and I unsuccessfully applied to the big quant trading firms. 
                    Since we couldn't get into a trading firm we decided to make our 
                    own. This project is part joke and part testbed for us to learn new things.      
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since we didn't (and still don't) know anything about trading we
                    decided to stick with making a minimum viable product and upgrading
                    iteratively. Right now our trading decision engine only focuses on
                    making a single trade per day by looking at the relative strength index
                    and only trading between fixed values. 
                </p>
                <p>We're also working on a noSQL database that can store the context of trades
                    amd what the decision engine's output -buy, hold, or sell.

                    I developed the New Instance Types Notifier while I 
                    interned at AWS for EC2’s Static Stability team during 
                    the summer of 2023. The Notifier is a workflow automation 
                    microservice designed to eliminate a weekly chore for the
                    Static Stability team and allow them to focus on the team’s 
                    important problems.</p>

                    <p>
                        I received my project in June 2023 and was responsible 
                        for developing it from end-to-end, including collecting 
                        requirements from my team, writing and rewriting my design 
                        document, and developing and iterating upon the end product. 
                        The notifier had two parts, one ran autonomously on EC2 and 
                        sent email updates to the team every week. The other part 
                        was mounted on the team’s dashboard and integrated with its 
                        backend API.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The notifier worked by collecting new EC2 types from several 
                        different internal services and fused the information together. 
                        Then it sorted out the instance types already ingested into the 
                        team’s testing framework. The dashboard displayed the list as is 
                        but the email notifier divided the list further into instance 
                        types with recently updated launch dates that merited further 
                        attention.

                        I was inspired to make this game by playing the New York Time’s 
                        crossword puzzle with my ski club on our trips. I knew I wanted to 
                        make a game that I could imagine my teammates playing. I based the 
                        game on the wikipedia game where a person uses links between wikipedia
                        pages to navigate the site between a beginning and destination page.
                        However with this game a person uses synonyms or antonyms between words
                        to jump to a destination word.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To make the game I used python's FastAPI library to create a barebones API
                        that can query Natual Language Tool Kit's (NLTK) wordnet library to find a 
                        list of synonyms and antonyms for words. The synonyms are in lists called 
                        synsets that have distinct semmantic meanings. I made the game itself in
                        react and it sends API calls every time the play wants to move to a new word.
